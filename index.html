        Password Prediction from Keyboard Acoustics: Unsupervised and Supervised Approaches
    </a>
    </h4>
    <p>
Previous studies have found that keyboard acoustics leak significant amount of information about typed text. Zhuang et al. (2004) demonstrated a method using an unsupervised model that learns the characteristic keystroke sounds of each key, using the output to train a more accurate and robust supervised model. We improve upon the results of that paper, demonstrating an unsupervised model that can predict typed characters with 81% accuracy. We also explore the applicability of this attack on guessing passwords and other sensitive information studies have found that keyboard acoustics leak significant amount of information about typed text.

        A review of text detection using stroke width constancy
    </a>
    </h4>
    <p>
In this paper, we explore using stroke-width information for text detection. We follow the general approach of Epshtein et al. but describe the process in more detail and explore different heuristics for refining our algorithm. We also describe methods of automatically detecting text for pictures with diverse image attributes.

        Improving Retrieval Performances for Invertible Bloom Counters
    </a>
    </h4>
    <p>
    We present a probabilistic data structure that repre- sents a multi-set, supporting insertion, deletions, queries, and listing operations. We demonstrate how extra metadata can improve the recoverable capacity while holding space constant.

        Buffer Management for LLAMA: A Graph Analytics System
    </a>
    </h4>
    <p>
    Graphs are ubiquitous in modern computing, and creating systems for efficient graph computation is a difficult problem. In particular, computing on graphs too large to fit in the memory of a machine requires special attention to memory management. We present a buffer management mechanism for LLAMA, a persistent graph analytics system. We show that our buffer management strategy can significantly improve performance on several query workloads, such as one-level neighborhood queries when recently queried nodes are queried with higher probability, friend-of-friends queries, and shortest path queries.

            Ranks of Elliptic Curves via the Shioda-Tate Theorem
        </a>
        (Senior Thesis)
    </h4>
        Elliptic curves are rich mathematical objects appearing in many different contexts, including Diophantine equations and cryptography. The points of an elliptic curve over a global field form a finitely generated abelian group. One open problem is whether there exist elliptic curves of arbitrarily high rank, and indeed, it is difficult to construct curves of high rank. We explore the connection between elliptic curves and elliptic surfaces using intersection theory and the Shioda-Tate theorem and construct elliptic curves isomorphic (as a lattice) to E8, with rank 10. This approach can be generalized to construct elliptic curves of higher rank and is a fruitful method for studying elliptic curves.

            The Hirzebruch Riemann Roch Theorem
        </a>
        (Junior Thesis)
    </h4>
    <p>
This paper discusses the Atiyah-Hirzebruch formulation of the Riemann Roch theorem for differentiable manifolds. This formulation, which is closely related to the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula for smooth algebraic varieties, relates the Gysin maps from K theory to the Gysin maps of ordinary cohomology via the Chern character. From the formula, we can deduce many divisibility properties of various characteristic classes.
